Predict cadmium concentration in spirngs

In this work we try to predict cadmium-contamination level using different machine learning algorithms:

1- Final Report.docx: This report includes a summary of data collection, EDA, feature selection, and modeling results.

2- EDA_new_version.ipynb : this notebook has the EDA implementation code

3- Feature_selection+regression_modeling.ipynb: This notebook has feature selection methods, and modeling implementation code
